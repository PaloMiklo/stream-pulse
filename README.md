# StreamPulse ðŸ“ˆ

StreamPulse is a multi-module, configurable, Java-compatible library written in Kotlin that enables real-time updates
for your application with
ease. Designed for modularity, it provides a core module that delivers essential functionality for managing long-lived
server-client connections, ideal for applications needing live updates, notifications, or continuous data streams. This
lightweight, framework-agnostic library simplifies the setup and management of these connections, allowing for easy
integration with any Java-based application.

# Key Features

- **Seamless Connections**: Easily initialize and manage long-lived connections for real-time data streaming.
- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Ensures stable connections with configurable heartbeats, automatically managing reconnections
  when needed.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize ping intervals, connection timeouts, and more for optimal performance.
- **Error Handling & Reconnect Logic**: Includes built-in mechanisms to handle connection errors and automated
  reconnections.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Minimal overhead, designed for efficient and responsive real-time applications.
- **Modular Architecture**: Built as a multi-module project for flexibility and future extensibility.

# Getting Started

Add StreamPulse to your project, configure your connection settings, and let it handle the rest. StreamPulse is built to
work smoothly with Java-based web servers like Tomcat and others that support HTTP streaming.

# Requirements

- Java 11+
- Compatible with Java-based web servers (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.)

# Integration

The project is hosted at [jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#PaloMiklo/stream-pulse).

# Configure Database Connection (experimental)

In your application.yml file, add the necessary configuration properties to connect to your database.

```yaml
streampulse:
  url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/db
  username: postgres
  password: postgres
  driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver
```

## Example Usage

java

```{r, results='asis'} java
ConnectionHolder streamPulse = createConnection(streamPulseBuilder().build(), request, response);
streamPulse.connection().sendEvent("Welcome to StreamPulse!");
```

# DEVELOPER

## Project Scripts Documentation

This documentation provides details on various scripts used for version management, building, testing, running, and
deployment in the project.
___
`version`   
Updates the project version across relevant files.

- Usage: `version.sh <new_version>`
- Description: Updates `<new_version>` in `pom.xml`, `pack.sh`, `run.sh`, and `build.gradle.kts` files.
- Details:
    - XML files: Replaces `<version>` tags within the group ID `com.palomiklo`.
    - Shell files: Updates any `VERSION` variables.
    - `build.gradle.kts`: Updates the version field.

___
`test`   
Runs tests for the specified module.

- Usage: `test.sh [core|spring]`
- Description:
    - Runs tests for either core or spring module.
    - If no module is specified, tests are run for both core and spring.

___
`run-spring`    
Compiles and runs the spring module.

- Description:
    - Compiles the spring module.
    - Starts the Spring Boot application if compilation succeeds.
- Environment Variable:
    - `PROFILES`: Used to specify active Spring profiles when running.

___
`run-core`   
Builds and runs the core module.

- Description:
    - Runs `pack.sh` to build the module.
    - Starts the core application. If `dependencies` is passed as an argument, it includes all JAR dependencies;
      otherwise, it creates a shadow JAR and runs it.

___
`rip-build`   
Removes build directories for the specified modules.

- Usage: `rip-build.sh [core|spring]`
- Description:
    - Deletes the `build` directory for either `core` or `spring`.
    - If no module is specified, deletes the `build` directories for both.

___
`pack`   
Builds and packages both `core` and `spring` modules.

- Description:
    - Compiles and packages both modules.
    - Displays success or failure messages for each module.

___
`install-local`     
Installs the project into the local Maven repository.

- Usage: `install-local.sh [tests|test|t]`
    - Description:
    - Installs the project to the local Maven repository.
    - If `tests` is specified, it runs tests; otherwise, it skips tests.

___
`ex-server`    
Deploys and runs the server.

- Description:
    - Loads paths from `paths.env` and `scripts.env`.
    - Navigates to `STREAM_PULSE_PATH` to install dependencies using `install-local.sh`.
    - Checks if the database is running for `CONSUMER_API_PATH`. If not, it starts the database and runs the consumer.

___
`ex-client`    
Executes the client application.

- Description:
    - Loads paths from paths.env and `scripts.env`.
    - Navigates to `CLIENT_PATH` and executes `CLIENT_EXE`.

___
Ensure environment files (`paths.env`, `scripts.env`) are correctly set up with required paths and executable
commands.
___

## Configuration Files Overview

- **`paths.env`**: Defines key directory paths for the project, including:
    - `STREAM_PULSE_PATH`: Path to the StreamPulse library.
    - `CONSUMER_API_PATH`: Path to the API consumer.
    - `CLIENT_PATH`: Path to the client application.

___

- **`scripts.env`**: Contains reusable functions for managing common tasks:
    - `CLIENT_EXE`: Starts the client application.
    - `DB_EXE`: Brings up the database.
    - `DB_VALIDATION`: Checks if the database is running.

These files are not part of the core library but are used in scripts to streamline project setup and execution.
